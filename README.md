## üóÇ Project Overview

This repository includes the following mini-projects:

### 1. Automobile Price Prediction
- File: `LinearRegression Automobile Dataset.py`  
- Dataset: `Automobile_data.csv`  
- **Goal**: Predict automobile prices using features like engine size, horsepower, curb weight, fuel efficiency, etc.

### 2. Bengaluru Housing Price Estimation
- File: `LinearRegression Bengaluru Housing Data.py`  
- Dataset: `bengaluru_house_prices.csv`  
- **Goal**: Estimate housing prices in Bengaluru using location, size, and amenity-based features.

### 3. Heart Disease Risk Prediction
- File: `LinearRegression Heart Disease Dataset.py`  
- Dataset: `heart_disease_dataset.csv`  
- **Goal**: Model heart disease likelihood using patient health metrics‚Äîage, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

### 4. Automobile Price Prediction (Polynomial Regression)
- File: `PolynomialRegression Automobile Dataset.py`
- Dataset: `Automobile_data.csv`
- Goal: Predict automobile prices using polynomial features of engine size, horsepower, curb weight, fuel efficiency, etc.

### 5. Bengaluru Housing Price Estimation (Polynomial Regression)
- File: `PolynomialRegression Bengaluru Housing Data.py`
- Dataset: `bengaluru_house_prices.csv`
- Goal: Estimate housing prices in Bengaluru using polynomial features of location, size, and amenity-based features.
